# Arch Unit Tests

### Overview
So today I was going through one of the conference videos an found this interesting topic which will help me test the

This will also allow my fellow colleagues to maintain some of the architecture rules that are defined by these test.

### Purpose

Here are some of the use cases I tried using this arch unit testing framework and I am finding them pretty helpful.
